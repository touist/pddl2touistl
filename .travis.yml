# The travis-ci servers are going to run this script on any push
# to the repo. Basically, it
# - tells the author of a commit if his commit has broken the build,
# - deploys two .zip containing the linux and osx apps, with the
#   touist compiled in it

# The commiter will be informed that one of his commits
